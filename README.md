# qPCR_ddCt_tcltk2

So you have been strugling with excel to get the qPCR results analysed? It took you one hour in generating the results demanded by your supervisor? I believe you! Then maybe this tool could help you in getting the results ready in 5 minutes!
The program is easy to understand, and works well on OSX (and I guess UNIX as well). Windows user might have problems, but we can sort this out together if you need my help.

To start the software, just double-click on the tktclk_ddct.R file. 

The results will be stored in the folder the CSV file was read from. 

The input csv file looks like this:

The results should look something like this (different colors correspond to different replicates):

And ddCT results will be ready waiting for you in the same folder as your input csv file.

Good luck! :)
