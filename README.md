# Fast analysis of raw qPCR results - qPCR_ddCt_tcltk2

So you have been strugling with excel to get the qPCR results analysed? It took you one hour in generating the results demanded by your supervisor? I believe you! Then maybe this tool could help you getting the results ready in less than 2 minutes!
The program is easy to understand, and works well on OSX (and I guess UNIX as well). Windows user might have problems, but we can sort this out together if you need my help.

To start the software, download and open tktclk_ddct.R.


# Input format requirements
The input csv file generated by our qPCR machine looks like this:

If your input csv file is different than the one you see above, then change these two lines of code to your needs:

```R
cq_values <- read.csv(file, skip = grep("Well", readLines(file)) - 1)
cq_values <- cq_values[c("Sample.Name", "Detector", "Ct")]
```

# Results generated
The ddCT results will be ready waiting for you in the same folder as your input csv file. 
The results should look like this:

Good luck and hope this helps :)
